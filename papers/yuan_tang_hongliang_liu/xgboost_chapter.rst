XGBoost: A Portable Distributed Gradient Boosting Library
------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solves many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. It runs on major distributed environment such as Hadoop, Spark, and Flink. More than half of the winning solutions in machine learning challenges hosted at Kaggle adopt XGBoost. In this chapter, we will illustrate the power of XGBoost and the wide range of use cases across industries.
